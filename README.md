## Compare performance of NER engines
To start comparison  
```sh
python compare.py --reference_file eval.tagged.txt --hypotheses_dir .
```
The script will consider that recognition results are stored in files having names like `eval.target.ner-bert.txt` or `eval.ner-bert.target.txt` if the reference file's name is `eval.tagged.txt`.
